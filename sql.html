          <div class="discription">
            <p>
              SQL is the standard language for dealing with Relational
              Databases.
            </p>
            <p>
              SQL is used to insert, search, update, and delete database
              records.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>How to Use SQL</h3>
          <p>
            The following SQL statement selects all the records in the
            "Customers" table:
          </p>
          <code> SELECT * FROM Customers; </code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="The_MySQL_SELECT_Statement">
          <header>The MySQL SELECT Statement</header>
          <div class="discription">
            <p>
              The <span>SELECT</span> statement is used to select data from a
              database.
            </p>
            <p>
              The data returned is stored in a result table, called the
              result-set.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>SELECT Syntax</h3>
          <code> SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name; </code>
          <p>
            Here, column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you
            want to select data from. If you want to select all the fields
            available in the table, use the following syntax:
          </p>
          <code> SELECT * FROM table_name; </code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="The_MySQL_WHERE_Clause">
          <header>The MySQL WHERE Clause</header>
          <div class="discription">
            <p>The <span>WHERE</span> clause is used to filter records.</p>
            <p>
              It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified
              condition.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>WHERE Syntax</h3>
          <code>
            SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition;
          </code>
          <p class="Note">
            <strong>Note</strong>: The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT
            statements, it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE, etc.!
          </p>

          <div class="discription">
            <p>
              The <span>WHERE</span> clause can be combined with
              <span>AND</span>, <span>OR</span>, and <span>NOT</span> operators.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <span>AND</span> and <span>OR</span> operators are used to
              filter records based on more than one condition:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The <span>AND</span> operator displays a record if all the
                conditions separated by <span>AND</span> are TRUE.
              </li>
              <li>
                The <span>OR</span> operator displays a record if any of the
                conditions separated by OR is TRUE.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The <span>NOT</span> operator displays a record if the
              condition(s) is NOT TRUE.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>AND Syntax</h3>
